# uQuest
**Overly customizable quest system plugin for Bukkit by Hawox**

I have taken uQuest and updated and built it for Bukkit 1.9.2(Also Spigot 1.9.2) and added a lot of new features to it.

I did this all for my server but wanted to share it with everyone.

So I got **Howax**'s permission to post it.

I have added a lot and done some changes, so decided not to fork it and instead start this repository from scratch.

Also need to give credit to **morganm** for putting in **Vault** support for Permissions and Economies.

Now updated to 1.9.2

Here is the link for the spigot build jar: [uQuest Spigot Jar](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58005429/uQuestSpigot/uQuest.jar)

Here is the link for the craftbukkit build jar: [uQuest Bukkit Jar](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58005429/uQuestBukkit/uQuest.jar)

Also build with Java 7

note: Right now it will not support name changing, if you change your name  you'll lose your quest progress.
      Also it will not support the new blocks in 1.9 or 1.8. Working on it.
