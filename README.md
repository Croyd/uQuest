I have taken uQuest and updated it for Bukkit 1.3.2 and added a lot of new features to it.
I did this all for my server but wanted to share it with everyone.
So I got Howax's permission to post it.

I have added a lot and done some changes, so decided not to fork it and instead start this repository from scratch.

There will be a changelog.txt file with the changes and other notes.

Also need to give credit to morganm for putting in vault support for Permissions and Economies.

So Vault is required for Permissions and Economies.
