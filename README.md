**Overly customizable quest system plugin for Bukkit by Hawox**

I have taken uQuest and updated it for Bukkit 1.3.2(Now 1.7.2) and added a lot of new features to it.

I did this all for my server but wanted to share it with everyone.

So I got **Howax**'s permission to post it.

I have added a lot and done some changes, so decided not to fork it and instead start this repository from scratch.

Also need to give credit to **morganm** for putting in **Vault** support for Permissions and Economies.

Now updated to 1.7.2
